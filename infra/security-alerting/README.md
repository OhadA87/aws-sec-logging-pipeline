# Security Alerting Module

This Terraform module provisions a real-time alerting pipeline that monitors suspicious activity â€” specifically SSH traffic â€” using VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch Logs, Metric Filters, and SNS email notifications.

## Purpose

Simulate real-world detection and alerting as implemented in high-tech companies to respond to:

- **Unauthorized SSH access attempts**
- **Brute-force scanning behavior**
- **Network intrusions via port 22**

## Resources Created

- **VPC Flow Logs** 
- **CloudWatch Log Group & Log Stream**
- **Metric Filter**: Monitors for SSH attempts
- **CloudWatch Alarm**: Triggers on suspicious SSH activity
- **SNS Topic**: Delivers alerts to specified email
- **Subscription**: Email subscription for alert delivery
